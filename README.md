# keylogger
How to use:  1. Right click on the python file named 'keylogger' and select "Edit with IDLE".  2. Replace 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE' with your Discord webhook link, then save the file with CTRL + S.  If you want the file to run in the background without any visible window, change the file extension from .py to .pyw  And you also got an .exe file.
